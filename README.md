This is a mini-project, where Iâ€™ve deconstructed an existing web page, 
the google.com homepage, and rebuilding it.

I have done my best to make my page to make my web page look 
like the google homepage. Demonstrating the skills of:

1. Structuring the right elements to form a look-a-like web page. 
2. Using google search and coding forums to make certain parts look more
like the google homepage. 
3. Using inspect to look deeper into the google home page and see what 
makes it what it is.
